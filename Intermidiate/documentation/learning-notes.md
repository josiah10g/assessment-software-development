# Learning Notes — Expense Tracker Project

## Challenges Faced
One of the challenges i faced was learning how to use Integrated AI models to make projects through the use of prompt engineering.

Another challenge i faced was using the whole Github workflow and earning how to create,use and write README files .


## Lessons Learned
1. Proper folder structure and separation of concerns (HTML, CSS, JS) make development easier to maintain.
2. Using arrays to store data in JavaScript allows for dynamic updates without a backend.
3. Simple responsive CSS can make a dashboard user-friendly on different screen sizes.
4. Documenting AI usage (prompts, intent, outcome) is essential for demonstrating responsible AI integration in projects.
5. Using Git,GitHb and AI Integrated tools to make projects.

## Improvements for the Future
1. Add LocalStorage so transactions persist after a page refresh.
2. Implement filtering and sorting of transactions by type, category, or date.
3. Add charts or graphs to visualize expenses and income trends.
4. Refactor code into modular components if the project grows in complexity.
